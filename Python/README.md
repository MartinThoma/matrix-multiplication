Here are Python implementations for matrix multiplication.
They are explained in two Blog articles:
* [Part I: Performance of Matrix multiplication in Python, Java and C++](http://martin-thoma.com/matrix-multiplication-python-java-cpp)
* [Part II: The Strassen algorithm in Python, Java and C++](http://martin-thoma.com/strassen-algorithm-in-python-java-cpp)

LEAF_SIZE.csv contains the execution time for calculating the
result of two 2000x2000 matrices that get multiplied when you vary
the LEAF_SIZE parameter.
